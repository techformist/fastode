# fastode

An opinionated web API server based on Fastify.

** Work in progress. **

Follow [@techformist](https://twitter.com/techformist) for updates.

Inspired by Laravel, AdonisJS and Fastify - Fastode builds on great work of smart developers to provide a toolset that let's you focus on building something beautiful.

Fastode is a framework that is not really a framework. We could have simply called it a boilerplate with a few changes in bits and pieces, but hey - where's the fun in that.

## Install

```
npm install --save fastode
```

CLI is planned for a brighter future.

## Usage

```
npm run start
```

Use [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) in production to maintain sanity and assure well being of all.

Monitor and react to changes (in development, yes):

```
npm run dev
```

## Core Objectives

- Provide a server that provides out of the box support for creating a full-fledged REST API server
- Be as near to Fastify as possible for faster and easier updates
- Fastify plugins should work without changes
- Offer structure and opinion even if no one asked for them

Fastode is easy to start with, and easy to maintain.

## Features

Fastode enables the following features right out of the box.

-

You can exploit(!?) the [Fastify ecosystem](https://www.fastify.io/ecosystem/) to add many more plugins or write your own.
